Offline Functionality:
- Enter deposits offline

*Express, Mongoose and Node are assumed to be on the user's computer already. In those cases where they are not the link to documentation has been included above.*

Those in grey boxes will require the user to download with the -D in the install phase so that it is grouped as devDependencies section. 

## Usage
To use locally, run `npm start` from your terminal and use localhost:3001 in your browser.

To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application.

The deployed application can be used at [Heroku]()
